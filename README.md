# Autonomous Junction
Computer Science Project

This is a computer science dissertation project, this project aims to demonstrate an autonomous car that transmits and recieves data from google cloud to determine if it can pull out of a junction or not. 

# Car

This folder contains all the code pertaining to the autonomous vehicle, it's ability to navigate the environment, and the code needed to pass messages through the roadside unit to google cloud.
